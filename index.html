<p>We make extensive use of AWS infrastructure <a href="https://twitter.com/_mydrive">@MyDrive</a>.
We've been using them for a long time, initially using them to mirror a more traditional
infrastructure using cloud resources, to allow portability between cloud providers.</p>

<p>More recently we've identified that we can make considerable cost and time savings
if we start using more of the baked in AWS Managed Services and we've begun that transition,
for example we have already moved our realational database infrastructure to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">RDS</a>.</p>

<p>We've also been cross skilling Developers and Operations staff to allow us to
cover leave and swarm more effectively on tasks. My background is as a Developer 
so I was looking forward to learn more about what services we could use to allow us
to deliver faster, and more consistency. I'm also on our Pager Duty rota, so I'm also
obviously very interested in services that make the operational maintenance someone
elses problem!</p>

<p>With this in mind we took most of the Software Engineering team to AWS's free
AWSome day, which is a one day event they hold a few times a year in London, and are
taking on tour around Europe, so we could learn what services we could be taking
advantage of already, and what was available to look to use in future.</p>

  <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>Here <a href="https://twitter.com/_mydrive">@MyDrive</a> we are aware that not everyone in
the world has the same possibilities of studying or sharpening their skills to
be more competent in the professional environment.</p>

<p>That's even more unfair when we focus on development/coding, mostly because of the
global nature Internet gives to our professional environment.</p>

<p>Luckily <a href="https://twitter.com/hackhands">@HackHands</a> guys came with a really nice
program. A special <strong>Africa Mentorship Program</strong> consisting on low-cost, remote pair
programming sessions for mentees enrolled in the program.</p>

<p>Mentees can pick their favourite subject among a wide range of useful and carefully
picked technologies like <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, <em>Python</em> or <em>JavaScript (MEAN stack)</em>,
then they are assigned a mentor and learning starts! (as far as Internet connectivity
allows it, of course :))</p>

<p>Personally I'm finding it very rewarding and easy. My mentee is a really smart and
enthusiastic girl that, when we had our first pairing session, she already had a lot
of important concepts well understood. Our strategy therefore is that she goes through
the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book">Rails Tutorial Book</a> by
<a href="https://twitter.com/mhartl">@Michael Hartl</a> on her own and when she feels stuck
or she has compiled a fair amount of questions then we schedule a new pairing
session of, normally, less than an hour to unblock her and we both think that this
is working great!</p>

  <div class="summary">
<p>Last week saw the first brand-name bug of 2015 in the shape of GHOST
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2015-0235">CVE</a>,
<a href="http://ma.ttias.be/ghost-critical-glibc-update-cve-2015-0235-gethostbyname-calls/">Explanation</a>.</p>

<p>Using our automated config management tools (Chef) we patched all systems
operated by MyDrive within 24 hours of a patch being made available by our
operating system vendor, and then performed a rolling reboot of all systems as
a precautionary measure to ensure all services were using the patched library.
This was all completed by noon UTC on Weds 28th Jan 2015.</p>

<p>MyDrive Solutions' operational staff closely monitor security disclosure
announcements, and patched all systems immediately when patches were issued by
our operating system vendor. Our automated configuration management tools
allow us to apply security patches such as this across our entire
infrastructure in moments.</p>

<p>We continue to proactively monitor our suppliers and vendors for issues
arising from security announcements.</p>

<p>We do not believe any action is required from our customers.</p>

  <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>Multi-Threading programming is one of those things that I like doing from time
to time. I find it particularly useful when automating any task that involves
network downloading.</p>

<p>My approach is usually a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">Publish-subscribe</a> using the very handy Ruby's
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/thread/rdoc/Queue.html"><code>Queue</code> class</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes I build it using several stages, i.e. last time I used it I was building
a tool for downloading and processing a whole S3 bucket and I designed it with
two messaging layers. First one publishes object names within the bucket
for the second one to pick them and actually download and process them and finally
publish the results for an aggregator thread (the main program's thread).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/2_stages_pub_sub_diagram.png" alt="2 Stages Pub Sub Diagram"></p>

<p>My programming approach to this is leveraging all synchronisation in queues rather
than waiting for threads or passing messages between them.
But don't worry, that's not a crazy or hacky approach at all, is just the Ruby's
recommended way.</p>

<p>So, what I'm going to do here is just explain by an example how to properly do
it avoiding errors and obtaining a clean end. Let's start off by showing a
failing example.</p>

<p>A vulnerability in a Ruby on Rails component was announced earlier today.</p>

<p>We have determined that MyDrive's applications were not vulnerable to attack as
we do not serve static assets through rails, instead we use our web server
(nginx). Nevertheless we have patched all production services using Ruby on
Rails.</p>
