<p>A couple of weeks ago we released a feature and it's performance was unexpectedly poor and here I want to share the steps and tools used to get to the root cause of the problem.</p>

<p>To give a little bit of background I'll tell you that the feature was something really common nowadays: <strong>Saving a bunch of time series in Cassandra</strong></p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Step 1: Look for evidences in metrics</h3>

<p>The natural first step I think everyone does is to look at the graphs (here we use graphite) and try to find evidences of what's going on.</p>

<p>In our case we had a very clear evidence that something was wrong as the time consumed in the process had increased by around 600% after the deploy!!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/events_latency_increase.png" alt="Massive time processing increase"></p>

<p>But that means that not only something is wrong in the feature but also, and even more scary, in our whole process!!
How can such a poorly performing piece of code have reached production without anyone noticing it before?
Ok, we don't have performance tests as part of our CI process, but we test every feature in our pre-production environments before going
to production and that should have appeared there!!
That would have simply been unacceptable and processes are easy and strong here <a href="https://twitter.com/_mydrive">@_MyDrive</a>, so,
after scrolling a little bit along the graphs we found an explanation. The tests ran in the pre-production environment were ok!</p>

<p>UPDATE: I've just received this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plv1oRda0d0">Amazing Timelapse</a> of the event! (Don't miss the <a href="https://twitter.com/BathRuby/status/576419163750731776">Happy Friday Hug moment</a> and the massive movement on breaks xD)</p>

<p>Friday 13, March 2015, 5.30am. My alarmclock rings. I don't feel tired but excited instead!.
Why? Lots of hours to enjoy learning Ruby from some of the top minds!!</p>

<p>So after several hours by train and car <a href="https://twitter.com/calonso/status/576330348163960832">here we are!!</a>,
we made it just in time to grab a coffee and then the talks started!</p>

<h4 id="toc_0"><a href="https://twitter.com/lindaliukas">Linda Liukas</a></h4>

<p>Linda showed us her <a href="http://www.helloruby.com/">successful KickStarter project: HelloRuby</a>, definitely a really nice idea
to introduce kids the passion for computing and programming.</p>

<p>Her talk gave us the idea of trying following her steps and try to get out a driving related project
using KickStarter funds. Would you like to see that happening? <a href="https://twitter.com/_MyDrive">Let us know!</a></p>

<h4 id="toc_1"><a href="https://twitter.com/r00k">Ben Orenstein</a></h4>

<p>Listening to Ben is definitely something very familiar to me as I've been following <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/">his Robots Podcast</a>
for several years, but meeting him in person was awesome!! Specially because of the great talk he did.</p>

<p>We make extensive use of AWS infrastructure <a href="https://twitter.com/_mydrive">@MyDrive</a>.
We've been using them for a long time, initially using them to mirror a more traditional
infrastructure using cloud resources, to allow portability between cloud providers.</p>

<p>More recently we've identified that we can make considerable cost and time savings
if we start using more of the baked in AWS Managed Services and we've begun that transition,
for example we have already moved our realational database infrastructure to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">RDS</a>.</p>

<p>We've also been cross skilling Developers and Operations staff to allow us to
cover leave and swarm more effectively on tasks. My background is as a Developer 
so I was looking forward to learn more about what services we could use to allow us
to deliver faster, and more consistency. I'm also on our Pager Duty rota, so I'm also
obviously very interested in services that make the operational maintenance someone
elses problem!</p>

<p>With this in mind we took most of the Software Engineering team to AWS's free
AWSome day, which is a one day event they hold a few times a year in London, and are
taking on tour around Europe, so we could learn what services we could be taking
advantage of already, and what was available to look to use in future.</p>

        <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>The aim of this post is to suggest that task switching is cognitively expensive and that Kanban as an agile methodology
lends itself to reducing the cost of task switching.</p>

<p>The approach to work in my last job was very different from MyDrive. Coming from a Linux System Administrator background, where an ad
hoc attitude was taken to the work I was given, I had to adapt to the work-on-one-thing-at-a-time mentalility
here which has some transformational benefits by comparison.</p>

<p>Luckily for me, the team here is incredibly proactive and are always willing to educate and improve on
how we work as a unit. We have already had detailed sessions on Kanban (today's session inspired this
post) which have highlighted the methodological limitations of my habits. A really great game that we played today
which illustrates the value of Kanban can be found here: <a href="https://darynholmes.wordpress.com/2011/08/02/the-x-penny-game/">https://darynholmes.wordpress.com/2011/08/02/the-x-penny-game/</a>.
I am convinced that the quality of your work is very much dependpent on your ability to focus on one thing
at a time and less about how brilliant you are at any given thing.</p>

<p>Kanban is a way of viewing and carrying out ongoing streams of work. The principals of Kanban are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with existing process;</li>
<li>Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change;</li>
<li>Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities and titles; and</li>
<li>Leadership at all levels.</li>
</ol>

        <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>Here <a href="https://twitter.com/_mydrive">@MyDrive</a> we are aware that not everyone in
the world has the same possibilities of studying or sharpening their skills to
be more competent in the professional environment.</p>

<p>That's even more unfair when we focus on development/coding, mostly because of the
global nature Internet gives to our professional environment.</p>

<p>Luckily <a href="https://twitter.com/hackhands">@HackHands</a> guys came with a really nice
program. A special <strong>Africa Mentorship Program</strong> consisting on low-cost, remote pair
programming sessions for mentees enrolled in the program.</p>

<p>Mentees can pick their favourite subject among a wide range of useful and carefully
picked technologies like <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, <em>Python</em> or <em>JavaScript (MEAN stack)</em>,
then they are assigned a mentor and learning starts! (as far as Internet connectivity
allows it, of course :))</p>

<p>Personally I'm finding it very rewarding and easy. My mentee is a really smart and
enthusiastic girl that, when we had our first pairing session, she already had a lot
of important concepts well understood. Our strategy therefore is that she goes through
the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book">Rails Tutorial Book</a> by
<a href="https://twitter.com/mhartl">@Michael Hartl</a> on her own and when she feels stuck
or she has compiled a fair amount of questions then we schedule a new pairing
session of, normally, less than an hour to unblock her and we both think that this
is working great!</p>
