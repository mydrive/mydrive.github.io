<p>Like most small companies we have trouble <a href="https://twitter.com/_mydrive">@MyDrive</a> in attracting the best
engineering staff when we're recruiting. We're not Google or Apple, with a huge
global presence, most developers have probably never heard of us. The current
job market for developers is really competitive, there aren't that many great
developers out there, most of them are already in work and everyone is competing
for them.</p>

<p>We've recently been recruiting for an iOS developer role, to lead the development
of our telematics apps. I think it's actually a really interesting, fun role, which
will involve lots of really quite difficult tasks, really stretching the technology.</p>

<p>Our challenge is to make sure that we can get that across in our job adverts.</p>

<p>Our process includes a couple of <a href="https://github.com/mydrive/code-tests">coding tests</a>. One of which
candidates can do on their own at home, and a much smaller one which we do in
house, just to verify what we've seen on the external test.</p>

<p>A few candidates have responded and taken the test and it gives a
good view of where someone is in their development. It also gives you a real
example to discuss with a candidate about why they made certain decisions, what
their thought processes were, and what they'd do differently next time. We haven't
found the right person yet, but it's been really worthwhile.</p>

<p>During the last couple of weeks we've been very focused on deeply understanding Cassandra's
write and read paths to build our models the best possible way.</p>

<p>After so much investigation I can summarize which are the steps we follow to assess our
model's performance.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">1. Have good practices and anti-patterns always in mind.</h3>

<p>Cassandra is known to be a very resilient and highly performant platform, but
only so long as you follow the rules and work with the underlying data model.</p>

<p>There are quite a few of these rules so my recommendation is to read through them
quickly before thinking of your model.</p>

<p>There are lots of places online where you can read about the good practices to follow
and anti-patterns to avoid when data modelling for Cassandra but I have my own
repository, here are the links:</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago we released a feature and it's performance was unexpectedly poor and here I want to share the steps and tools used to get to the root cause of the problem.</p>

<p>To give a little bit of background I'll tell you that the feature was something really common nowadays: <strong>Saving a bunch of time series in Cassandra</strong></p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Step 1: Look for evidences in metrics</h3>

<p>The natural first step I think everyone does is to look at the graphs (here we use graphite) and try to find evidences of what's going on.</p>

<p>In our case we had a very clear evidence that something was wrong as the time consumed in the process had increased by around 600% after the deploy!!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/events_latency_increase.png" alt="Massive time processing increase"></p>

<p>But that means that not only something is wrong in the feature but also, and even more scary, in our whole process!!
How can such a poorly performing piece of code have reached production without anyone noticing it before?
Ok, we don't have performance tests as part of our CI process, but we test every feature in our pre-production environments before going
to production and that should have appeared there!!
That would have simply been unacceptable and processes are easy and strong here <a href="https://twitter.com/_mydrive">@_MyDrive</a>, so,
after scrolling a little bit along the graphs we found an explanation. The tests ran in the pre-production environment were ok!</p>

<p>UPDATE: I've just received this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plv1oRda0d0">Amazing Timelapse</a> of the event! (Don't miss the <a href="https://twitter.com/BathRuby/status/576419163750731776">Happy Friday Hug moment</a> and the massive movement on breaks xD)</p>

<p>Friday 13, March 2015, 5.30am. My alarmclock rings. I don't feel tired but excited instead!.
Why? Lots of hours to enjoy learning Ruby from some of the top minds!!</p>

<p>So after several hours by train and car <a href="https://twitter.com/calonso/status/576330348163960832">here we are!!</a>,
we made it just in time to grab a coffee and then the talks started!</p>

<h4 id="toc_0"><a href="https://twitter.com/lindaliukas">Linda Liukas</a></h4>

<p>Linda showed us her <a href="http://www.helloruby.com/">successful KickStarter project: HelloRuby</a>, definitely a really nice idea
to introduce kids the passion for computing and programming.</p>

<p>Her talk gave us the idea of trying following her steps and try to get out a driving related project
using KickStarter funds. Would you like to see that happening? <a href="https://twitter.com/_MyDrive">Let us know!</a></p>

<h4 id="toc_1"><a href="https://twitter.com/r00k">Ben Orenstein</a></h4>

<p>Listening to Ben is definitely something very familiar to me as I've been following <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/">his Robots Podcast</a>
for several years, but meeting him in person was awesome!! Specially because of the great talk he did.</p>

<p>We make extensive use of AWS infrastructure <a href="https://twitter.com/_mydrive">@MyDrive</a>.
We've been using them for a long time, initially using them to mirror a more traditional
infrastructure using cloud resources, to allow portability between cloud providers.</p>

<p>More recently we've identified that we can make considerable cost and time savings
if we start using more of the baked in AWS Managed Services and we've begun that transition,
for example we have already moved our realational database infrastructure to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">RDS</a>.</p>

<p>We've also been cross skilling Developers and Operations staff to allow us to
cover leave and swarm more effectively on tasks. My background is as a Developer 
so I was looking forward to learn more about what services we could use to allow us
to deliver faster, and more consistency. I'm also on our Pager Duty rota, so I'm also
obviously very interested in services that make the operational maintenance someone
elses problem!</p>

<p>With this in mind we took most of the Software Engineering team to AWS's free
AWSome day, which is a one day event they hold a few times a year in London, and are
taking on tour around Europe, so we could learn what services we could be taking
advantage of already, and what was available to look to use in future.</p>
