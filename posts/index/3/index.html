<p>A vulnerability in a Ruby on Rails component was announced earlier today.</p>

<p>We have determined that MyDrive's applications were not vulnerable to attack as
we do not serve static assets through rails, instead we use our web server
(nginx). Nevertheless we have patched all production services using Ruby on
Rails.</p>

<p>No action is required from our customers.</p>

        <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>A couple of security vulnerabilities were announced this week which are worth noting.</p>

<p>The first was a vulnerability in SSL V3, which was nicknamed
<a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html">POODLE</a>
by the researchers who discovered it. This protocol is 18 years old, but was
still widely supported. After the announcement, MyDrive removed support for SSL
v3 from all web servers and load balancers. Updates were completed on
Wednesday 15th October 2014.</p>

<p>The second notable vulnerability was in
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2385-1/">OpenSSL</a>. All servers were patched and
affected servers or services rebooted on Thursday 16th October 2014. This patch
also provided additional protection against the POODLE bug.</p>

<p>MyDrive Solutions' operational staff closely monitor security disclosure
announcements, and patched all systems immediately when patches were issued by
our operating system vendor. Our automated configuration management tools
allow us to apply security patches such as this across our entire
infrastructure in moments.</p>

<p>We continue to proactively monitor our suppliers and vendors for issues
arising from security announcements.</p>

        <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>Here at MyDrive we are completely data-driven and as such we need to collect
as much data as possible. This data is then analysed by our data scientists and/or
used for Machine Learning purposes. To collect all that data we have designed and created our
own iOS data collection app (a.k.a. the iOS awesome app) that silently records
all our movements (lovely, isn't it?).</p>

<p>Now let's get to the technical part. The application has been written in Apple's
brand new programming language: Swift, and we started developing it since it was
in beta version, so that means that parts of our codebase had to be rewritten to
adopt the incoming changes from any new released beta.</p>

<p>That has been my first hands-on time with Swift and I have to say that I like it.
Although I used to like it more in one of the betas than in the current first release.
The idea of writing</p>

<pre><code class="swift">if var v = some_method() {

}
</code></pre>

<p>Between 24th and 27th September 2014 a number of vulnerabilties were exposed in
the <code>GNU bash</code> software installed on most computers running Linux, including:</p>

<p><a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271">CVE-2014-6271</a></p>

<p><a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-7187">CVE-2014-7187</a></p>

<p>These vulnerability could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on remote
servers, was given the nickname
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)">Shellshock</a>,
and was widely reported in both technical and mainstream media.</p>

<p>Based on our analysis of the vulnerability in context of the services we
operate and our system configuration we do not believe our infrastructure was
susceptible to attack using this vulnerability.</p>

<p>MyDrive Solutions' operational staff closely monitor security disclosure
announcements, and patched all systems immediately when patches were issued by
