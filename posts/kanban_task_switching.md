The aim of this post is to suggest that task switching is cognitively expensive and that Kanban as an agile methodology
lends itself to reducing the cost of task switching.

A beginning is a very important time in a person's career. This has recently been highlighted to me in terms
of the bad habits I developed in my previous job. Coming from a Linux System Administrator background, where an ad
hoc attitude was taken to the work I was given, I struggled to adapt to the work-on-one-thing-at-a-time mentalility 
here [@MyDrive](https://twitter.com/_mydrive). I have found myself switching between different tasks and noticed that
this had quite a significantly adverse affect on my ability to deliver quality output when compared to other members of
the team. And it was not making me feel good about my contributions.

Luckily for me, the team here is incredibly proactive and are always willing to educate and improve on
how we work as a unit. We have already had detailed sessions on Kanban (today's session inspired this
post) which have highlighted the methodological limitations of my habits. I think I need to stress that
if you are starting out in your career as a developer, then there is nothing more important than getting the
best possible mentors who demand a high standard of work from you. This is just as much about your sacrifice
in terms of accepting criticism of the way you think about a problem as it is about their ability to accept
and improve on your weakness and in engaging with you on the reasons for actions and design decisions. I believe that 
the quality of your work is very much dependpent on your ability to focus on one thing 
at a time and less about how brilliant you are at any given thing. Your journey to self-mastery in programming
is at stake in this fairly simple lesson.

Kanban is a way of viewing and carrying out ongoing streams of work. The principals of Kanban are:

1. Start with existing process;
2. Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change;
3. Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities and titles; and
4. Leadership at all levels.

The focus is on increasing flow by evolving existing processes without overhauling everything all at once. 
Kanban boards visually represent the flow of work from 'in the backlog' to 'done'. They encourage people to focus
on what is blocking work from being completed and on knowing what the whole team is currently working on which
gives context to the whole process for everyone in the team.

Limits are put on the amount of work that is currently in progress in order to maximise flow. Furthermore, tasks in Kanban
are clearly defined and supposed to be reduced to the least possible shippable complexity. 

All of these features of Kanban directly act to:
  a) decrease the cost of switching tasks; and
  b) decrease the frequency of task switching in any given moment.

Psychological research has shown the detrimental effects of varying rapidities of task switching on performance across a whole
range of tasks (too many to mention here) and has also highlighted it's complex neurological correlates. The more complex the
task the more expensive it is to switch your focus onto this new thing.

Either way, what you discover when working on complex and intense tasks is that keeping focussed and avoiding working
on multiple tasks in quick succession is essential for your code quality and your sanity.
