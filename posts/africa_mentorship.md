Here [@MyDrive](https://twitter.com/_mydrive) we are aware that not everyone in
the world has the same possibilities of studying or sharpening their skills to
be more competent in the professional environment.

That's even more unfair when we focus on development/coding, mostly because of the
global nature Internet gives to our professional environment.

Luckily [@HackHands](https://twitter.com/hackhands) guys came with a really nice
program. A special **Africa Mentorship Program** consisting on low-cost, remote pair
programming sessions for mentees enrolled in the program.

Mentees can pick their favourite subject among a wide range of useful and carefully
picked technologies like *Ruby on Rails*, *Python* or *JavaScript (MEAN stack)*,
then they are assigned a mentor and learning starts! (as far as Internet connectivity
allows it, of course :))

Personally I'm finding it very rewarding and easy. My mentee is a really smart and
enthusiastic girl that, when we had our first pairing session, she already had a lot
of important concepts well understood. Our strategy therefore is that she goes through
the [Rails Tutorial Book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) by
[@Michael Hartl](https://twitter.com/mhartl) on her own and when she feels stuck
or she has compiled a fair amount of questions then we schedule a new pairing
session of, normally, less than an hour to unblock her and we both think that this
is working great!

So we'd like to encourage all of you to schedule your week so that you can get
one hour to help someone and, that way, give back a little bit of the love
that the developers community gives us!
